[*Qwiic USB Development Kit - SAMD21 (SPX-24639)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24639)

The Qwiic USB Development kit is designed for folks that want to interface a Qwiic device quickly and easily to a computer. The core processor is the SAM21 which allows quick (hah!) and seamless serial printing over USB, as well as easy development and programming using the Arduino environment. The professional printed enclosure makes the device easy to plug/unplug as well as allowing Qwiic boards to be mounted to the enclosure itself.

The development kit features two Qwiic connectors and a user-addressable WS2812 LED. In case you need more IO, there are four GPIO pins, accessible by removing the enclosure, two of which are ADC pins. This little device is not only a great tool for making compact prototypes, but a handy way to add Qwiic sensors to your PC-based projects.
